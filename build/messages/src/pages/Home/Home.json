    "defaultMessage": "ReCodEx is a system for dynamic analysis and evaluation of programming exercises. It is a set of components, which allows assigning practical programming problems to students by theit supervisors throught web interface. After solving the problem students upload their solution to the system and ReCodEx automaticaly evaluates them (typically checking corectness of program output) and assigns corresponding amount of points. Students have quick feedback about their solution and supervisors does not have to manually check each solution for basic coretness (like that the program compiles and gives correct results in reasonable time)."
